# Obsidian League of Legends highlights importer (from league_record)
Automatically import deaths in league of legends from league_record (todo, link) into obsidian for easy and quick death reviews.

If you didn't know, [league record](https://github.com/FFFFFFFXXXXXXX/league_record) is an awesome open source software written by [FFFFFFFXXXXXXX](https://github.com/FFFFFFFXXXXXXX) that makes recording lol vods easy and efficient

## Usage
1) make a folder named "lol" in the root of your vault
2) Change settings to point to correct league_record folder
3) Press the ribbon on the left

## Installation
Just like any other obsidian plugin. 
Download the release and unzip it in .obsidian/plugins

## Limitations
* league_record does not give data regarding game mode of the mode, for example, its currently not possible to differentiate between flex/soloduo/normal summoners rift 5v5 since they all show up as "Classic"
* Cannot log teammate deaths since league_record does not store them. This would be handy for junglers early game thinking if they could have prevented such a death by for example covering lane.

## Known bugs
none, but let me know if u find any

## Future plans/todos
* Do the work to actually log kills, assists, drakes, etc instead of just deaths
* give the option to turn autoplay on/off

## Disclaimer
not affiliated with league_record, just a fan of the project and a stats nerd
